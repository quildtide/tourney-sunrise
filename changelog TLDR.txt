TLDR:
- factories no longer consume additional resources on paper, but still require some extra resources due to higher unit costs

- walls are cheaper
- jackal and scarab turrets are cheaper and more durable, scarabs have longer range
- Reclaim turret exists, and CAN ONLY RECLAIM WRECKAGE, not trees or living units 
- liberator recon turret exists, provides a cheap source of true vision

- lancers do big damage, shoot a bit slower, match dox range
- STOKES SHOOT AIR, are 16 speed
- walker fabs are chonky, vehicle fabs use current live stats of walker fab
- guardians (combat fabs) are cheaper, and can build liberators, reclaim turrets, and shredders in  addition to their current build options
- deathmark and monstro prioritize advanced units and structures

- meteor is significantly less tanky now
- comet is now produced from t2 flyer foundry rather than by fabbers
- nova has been reworked, it now spawns a suicide unit that chases you around
